      <p>Drug abuse can have serious health consequences at any age,
      but teens who use drugs are especially vulnerable. Teens who
      use drugs are more likely to develop an addiction later in life
      and to suffer from permanent and irreversible brain damage.
      Other common negative consequences of teen drug abuse
      involve: </p>
      <br>

      <p> <mark>*Unhealthy coping mechanisms</mark> - like Anxiety, depression,
      mood swings, suicidal thoughts, and schizophrenia can all be
      caused or masked by drug abuse. In fact, 34.6 percent of teens
      with major depression report using drugs. Unfortunately, drug
      abuse can intensify the severity of these emotional issues.
      Teens who use illicit drugs on a weekly basis, for example,
      double their risk of depression and anxiety.</p>
      <br>

      <p><mark>*Learning disabilities</mark> - Drug abuse harms both short-term and
      long-term memory and can lead to learning and memory
      problems later in life.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><mark>*Traumatic brain</mark> - Teens who use needles to abuse drugs are
      more likely to contract blood-borne diseases such as HIV,
      AIDS, and Hepatitis B and C.</p>
      <br>
      <p><mark>*Damage to the brain</mark>*Damage to the brain - Teen drug abuse can result in serious
      mental disorders or permanent, irreversible brain or nervous
      system damage. Brain damage in drug-addicted teens includes
      shrinkage of the brain, impaired learning abilities, amnesia
      and memory problems, impaired reasoning, perception, and
      intuition, increased or decreased peer interaction, and changes
      in sexual desire.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><mark>*Car accidents</mark> - Youngsters who use drugs are more likely to
      be involved in car accidents that result in injuries or death. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Control and Management</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1) Discover effective ways to manage peer pressure </h3>
      <br>
      <p>Humans have a tendency to not want to be left out, especially
      by their friends and peers. As a result, most teenagers and
      some adults initiate taking drugs in order to fit in with their
      peers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If you find yourself in this situation, try to muster up the
      courage to say no. Better yet, you can make new friends who
      will not pressure you to adopt their habits. When you are
      tempted to try drugs, make an excuse that will get you out of
      the situation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>2) Look for better coping mechanisms
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>Many people who abuse drugs see it as a coping mechanism
      for the negative things in their lives. It is critical to understand
      that there is nothing wrong with feeling negative emotions.
      Find better ways to deal with them instead of turning to drugs
      for solace. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Among many of the effective coping mechanisms are
      </h4>
      <br>
      <p>*conversing with someone
      <br>
      *Meditation
      <br>
      *Yoga
      <br>
      *Taking notes on it
      <br>
      *Exercising
      <br>
      *Trying out any of these mechanisms diverts your attention
      away from drugs.
      <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>3) Choose your circle of friends carefully </h3>
      <br>
      <p>Make sure you surround yourself with people who love
      and support you and discourage you from attempting
      substance abuse. Such people also provide a safe
      environment in which drug and alcohol risk factors are
      less likely to be triggered.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>4) Always allow yourself some alone time</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Imagine spending your whole day by studying and doing all
      the activities you do and forgetting to give yourself your alone
      time and resting and doing things you actually love.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>During your alone time you can:
      </h4>
      <br>
      <p>*Read your favorite books <br>
      *Taking a hot bath <br>

      *Distancing yourself from your phones and social media
      <br>
      </p>
      <h3>5) Analyze any possible risk factors</h3>
      <br>

      <p>Knowing ahead of time about any potential drug abuse risk
      factors makes it easier to overcome them. For example, if
      your family has a history of substance abusers, you can
      promise yourself that you will not follow in their footsteps.
      Also, if you have a friend who is a chronic drug user, you can
      choose to end the friendship rather than being dragged into his
      behaviors. </p>
